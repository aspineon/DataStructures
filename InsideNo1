1
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,001
OH.

2
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,286
HELLO.

3
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,920
HELLO.

4
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,484
THAT WAS QUICK.

5
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,686
HMM.

6
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,008
WELL, OBVIOUSLY I KNOW THE HOUSE, SO...

7
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,607
SO YOU HAVE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.
UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. YES.

8
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,723
MMM.
MMM.

9
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,251
WELL, LET'S...

10
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,366
COME ON IN.

11
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,402
ARE YOU NOT GOING TO GET THE...?
OH.

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,520
SORRY, WE WEREN'T PROPERLY INTRODUCED.
I'M IAN, BY THE WAY.

13
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,086
HELLO.

14
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,564
HOLD ON, JUST...
OH.

15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,881
IT'S RACHEL, ISN'T IT?

16
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,849
REBECCA.
REBECCA.

17
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,729
I WORK WITH JEREMY.
OH.

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,122
I SAY WORK WITH.
I'M MORE ON THE IT SIDE.

19
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,615
BUT OBVIOUSLY WITH HIM
BEING THE OFFICE MANAGER,

20
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,927
THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF OVERLAP.

21
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,485
HE'S MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE
WHEREAS I TAKE MORE OF A LEAD

22
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,800
IN PROGRAM DEVELOP...
RIGHT.

23
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,727
WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS AGAIN?

24
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,245
IT'S IAN.
THAT'S RIGHT, YES,

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,368
JEREMY HAS MENTIONED YOU.

26
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,926
MMM.
SHH.

27
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,008
WONDER WHO THAT WAS?
DON'T KNOW.

28
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,410
IT COULD BE A LONG GAME.

29
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,766
YES.

30
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,522
SO, HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE ENGAGED, RACHEL?

31
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,965
REBECCA.
REBECCA.

32
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,568
HAVE YOU SET A DATE YET?
THE 9TH OF NOVEMBER.

33
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,166
OH, DEAR.

34
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,926
THAT'S 9/11.

35
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,520
YOU'LL NOT FORGET THAT IN A HURRY,
WILL YOU?

36
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,366
OH.

37
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,806
NO, I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY,
TO BE HONEST.

38
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,040
WELL, YOU MUST.

39
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,842
UM, I WAS CHRISTENED
RICHARD IAN PERCIVAL,

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,406
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.

41
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,881
RIP.

42
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,087
BOO.

43
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,764
OH, CARL. GET IN QUICK.

44
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,207
I HEARD YOU TALKING.
VERY SLACK, REBECCA.

45
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,446
WHY ARE YOU HIDING IN HERE?
I DIDN'T CHOOSE IT, DID I?

46
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,927
GUILTY AS CHARGED.
HAVE YOU MET IAN?

47
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,369
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE
I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE.

48
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,647
CARL. I'M REBECCA'S BROTHER.

49
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,610
SO YOU MUST KNOW ALL THE NOOKS
AND CRANNIES OF THE HOUSE THEN?

50
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,091
OH, YES.

51
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,051
I SPENT MOST OF MY CHRISTMASES
HIDING IN VARIOUS CUPBOARDS

52
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,726
WAITING FOR MY BOSSY
LITTLE SISTER TO FIND ME.

53
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,130
YOU NEVER COULD THOUGH, COULD YOU?

54
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,486
GET IN.

55
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,645
IS DADDY PLAYING?

56
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,848
HE SAID HE WOULD.

57
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,810
HE'S OUT SHOWING MARK
AND ELIZABETH THE STABLES.

58
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,535
WELL, HE CAN DO THAT AFTERWARDS!
WE'RE MEANT TO BE PLAYING THE GAME!

59
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,564
IT'S ALL RIGHT, KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.
YOU'LL GIVE US ALL AWAY.

60
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,847
YEAH, CHILL OUT, BITCH.

61
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,443
SORRY, THAT WAS MISJUDGED.

62
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,724
ACTUALLY, IT WAS QUITE FUNNY.

63
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,415
SHE IS A BIT OF A BITCH,
AREN'T YOU, BECKS?

64
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,644
LOLLIPOPS.

65
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,091
COME AND GET YOUR LOLLIPOPS.

66
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,642
WHERE ARE THOSE CHILDREN HIDING?

67
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,485
NOW THEN, IF I WERE GOING
TO SECRETE MESELF IN THIS ROOM,

68
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,403
WHERE WOULD I GO?

69
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,723
NOT BEHIND THOSE CURTAINS,
THEY'RE A MIGRAINE WAITING TO HAPPEN.

70
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,166
OH, HANGING AROUND THE TOILETS, PERHAPS.

71
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,286
IT HAS BEEN KNOWN.

72
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,526
OR WOULD I ENJOY
SPENDING TIME IN THE CLOSET?

73
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,202
OH! NOT INTERRUPTING ANYTHING, I HOPE?

74
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,441
COME ON.

75
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,211
WHOA, IT'S LIKE THE BACK ROOM
OF CINDERELLA'S AT WAKEFIELD.

76
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,248
HAS ANYONE GOT ANY POPPERS OR LUBE?
STUART.

77
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,810
YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER THEN, DO YOU?

78
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,247
UNFORTUNATELY, YES.
THEY' RE PARTNERS.

79
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,207
IN WHAT LINE?

80
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,335
UH, WELL, IT USED TO BE STRAIGHT UP
AND DOWN, BUT NOT ANYMORE.

81
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,362
I'M IN IT.

82
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,842
CONGRATULATIONS. I'M IN SHIT,
COS I GOT IN LATE LAST NIGHT, DIDN'T I?

83
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,571
STUART, YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE,
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

84
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,891
OH, I SEE.

85
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,005
YOU'RE "LIVING TOGETHER" PARTNERS?

86
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,800
OH, YEAH, WE'RE QUEER, DEAR.
GET USED TO IT.

87
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,135
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT,
I CAN'T STAY HERE...

88
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,321
CARL, PLEASE.

89
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,366
STUART, BEHAVE.

90
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,815
THIS PARTY IS NOT ABOUT YOU.
IT'S ABOUT ME AND JEREMY, SO BUTT OUT!

91
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,921
CARL.

92
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,325
YOU'RE MUCH PRETTIER
WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY AND SO ARE YOU.

93
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,085
ANYWAY, CHANGING THE SUBJECT SLIGHTLY,
I'M NOT BEING FUNNY,

94
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,322
BUT THERE'S A MAN DOWNSTAIRS
THAT ABSOLUTELY STINKS.

95
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,686
YES, THAT'S STINKY JOHN.

96
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,535
AND WHAT IS IT?
IS IT HIS CLOTHES, HIS BREATH?

97
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,686
I DON'T KNOW.

98
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,055
HE WAS AT SCHOOL WITH US,
WASN'T HE, CARL?

99
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,401
YES, THAT'S WHEN HE WAS JUST JOHN,
NOT STINKY JOHN.

100
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,166
SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM.
HE JUST STOPPED WASHING ONE DAY.

101
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,641
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRACE IT BACK.
MAYBE WE SHOULD.

102
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,401
WHO DO YOU STINK YOU ARE?

103
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,720
AND WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER ONES,
WHO'S THAT BORING ONE?

104
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,649
YES, AND ERM...

105
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,855
WHAT ABOUT THAT OLD WOMAN
THAT'S WANDERING AROUND?

106
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,245
OH, GOD, THAT'S GERALDINE.

107
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,891
SHE'S DADDY'S CLEANER.
I ASKED HER TO COME AND SERVE DRINKS

108
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,564
BUT SHE THINKS SHE'S A GUEST.

109
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,768
THAT IS HILAR.
YOU'VE GOT TO TELL HER.

110
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,410
I CAN'T NOW. SHE'S ALL DRESSED UP.

111
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,130
DRESSED UP?
SHE LOOKS LIKE FEED THE BIRDS.

112
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,244
THERE'S A SANDWICH MAN
AT WORK WHO, ERM,

113
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,450
WEARS A YELLOW T-SHIRT, THIS...
A JERSEY, BUT IT'S T-SHIRT MATERIAL.

114
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,524
AND ALL THE GIRLS CALL HIM
MUSTARD MIKE.

115
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,280
WELL, THANK GOD
I BROUGHT CHAMPAGNE.

116
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,486
WHO WANTS A SWIG?

117
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,643
FOUND THEM! THEY'RE HERE!
SHH.

118
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,320
THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT? I'VE WON?
NO, YOU'VE GOT TO HIDE AS WELL.

119
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,885
OH, OKAY.

120
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,043
NO, IN HERE WITH US.

121
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,727
OH, THERE'S NOT
REALLY MUCH SPACE IN THERE.

122
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,080
THAT'S WHY IT'S FUN, APPARENTLY.

123
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,684
I'M A LITTLE BIT CLAUSTROPHOBIC.
THEN IT'S EVEN MORE FUN.

124
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,286
QUICK, BEFORE SOMEONE SEES YOU.

125
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,611
SO, WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

126
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,244
WE WAIT FOR THE OTHERS TO FIND US.

127
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,801
SO HOW DO YOU WIN?

128
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,287
NOBODY WINS. YOU JUST WAIT.

129
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,246
OH.

130
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,726
RIGHT.

131
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,480
SO WHEN DOES THE GAME START?

132
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,488
THIS IS THE GAME, RACHEL.
WE'RE PLAYING IT.

133
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,726
OH.

134
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,851
SO YOU'RE RACHEL, ARE YOU?
YES, HELLO.

135
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,605
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN CALLING
REBECCA RACHEL, HAVEN'T I?

136
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,806
YES.

137
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,442
I THINK I JUST GOT MIXED UP BECAUSE
JEREMY TALKS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME.

138
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,961
DOES HE?

139
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,286
YES.

140
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,366
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

141
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,815
WHICH ONE ARE YOU AGAIN?
REBECCA.

142
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,921
YES.

143
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,375
OH, I'VE NOT SEEN THIS MUCH
WOOD SINCE I WAS...

144
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,481
DON'T.

145
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,295
SO WHAT DOES JEREMY SAY ABOUT ME?
I'M SORRY.

146
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,970
AT WORK, YOU SAID HE TALKS ABOUT ME.

147
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,451
OH, JUST...

148
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,403
THE USUAL BORING GIRLFRIEND STUFF.

149
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,926
BORING GIRLFRIEND?

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,324
NOT THAT YOU'RE BORING,
JUST THE STUFF HE SAYS ABOUT YOU IS...

151
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,481
BORING?

152
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,486
YES.

153
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,006
WELL, COMING FROM YOU, IAN,
THAT'S QUITE SOMETHING. THANK YOU.

154
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,204
YOU'RE WELCOME.

155
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,328
IS ANYONE ELSE GETTING HOT?

156
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,695
I JUST NEED TO OPEN THE DOOR A CRACK.
I JUST NEED TO GET SOME AIR.

157
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,530
WAIT TILL STINKY JOHN GETS HERE,
YOU'LL NEED MORE THAN A CRACK.

158
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,761
IS STINKY JOHN PLAYING?

159
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,842
EVERYBODY'S PLAYING. IT'S SARDINES.

160
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,535
OH, I DON'T KNOW IF
I CAN STAY IN HERE IF HE GETS IN.

161
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,815
I DO GET A LITTLE BIT, ERM...

162
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,080
DON'T WORRY, DEAR, ME AND YOU
WILL NIP THROUGH TO NARNIA,

163
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,735
HAVE A SNOWBALL FIGHT,
GET SOME TURKISH DELIGHT.

164
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,286
OH, SORRY, I NEED TO BREATHE.
NO, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED...

165
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,850
SHE'S ALLOWED TO BREATHE.

166
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,561
I WOULDN'T MIND STRETCHING
THE OLD LEGS ACTUALLY.

167
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,880
BEEN IN HERE A WHILE.

168
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,848
WHAT? OH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

169
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,880
I'M GOING TO HAVE A PEE BREAK THEN,
THAT CHAMPAGNE'S GONE RIGHT THROUGH ME.

170
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,167
WELL, DON'T FLUSH IT.
OH, DON'T WORRY, I WON'T.

171
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,401
YOU KNOW MY MOTTO.

172
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,840
IF IT'S YELLOW, LET IT MELLOW,
IF IT'S BROWN, FLUSH IT DOWN.

173
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,242
OH! OCCUPIED.

174
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,561
SORRY!

175
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,560
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING
I SHALL NEVER UN-SEE.

176
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,644
<i>WHO IS IT?
FEED THE BIRDS.</i>

177
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,767
GERALDINE.

178
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,002
SHOULDN'T SHE BE USING
THE STAFF TOILETS?

179
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,451
YOU OKAY?

180
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,365
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK, REBECCA?

181
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,405
LOOK WHERE WE ARE.

182
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,441
OH, THERE YOU GO, LOVEY. DOESN'T
HAVE A LOCK, IT'S AN EN SUITEY.

183
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,124
YOU'VE WARMED THE SEAT FOR ME.

184
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,241
I HEARD YOU ALL TALKING IN THERE,
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DISTURB YOU.

185
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,251
THAT'S A BONNY DRESS.

186
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,567
THANK YOU. I GOT IT IN PARIS.

187
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,281
MY HIP WENT THAT COLOR WHEN I FELL
UP SOME STEPS AT LEGOLAND.

188
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,971
I WAS JUST GETTING SOME AIR.
I'M A BIT CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

189
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,760
IS THAT WHERE YOU CAN'T BEAR
TOUCH A SNAKE?

190
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,440
YOU'VE GOT THAT, HAVEN'T YOU, CARL?

191
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,768
I'D HARDLY CALL IT
A SNAKE, STUART.

192
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,210
MORE LIKE A SCALY LIZARD.

193
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,691
I HEARD THAT.
GOOD.

194
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,721
RIGHT. SHALL WE, UH,

195
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,004
ASSUME THE POSITION?

196
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,120
IT'S JUST A GAME.

197
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,761
JUST BE A SEC.

198
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,927
WAIT FOR ME.

199
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,206
ROOM FOR A LITTLE 'UN?

200
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,204
OF COURSE THERE IS.

201
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,763
IT'S LIKE THE TIME AND RELATIVE
DIMENSION IN SPACE.

202
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,841
TARDIS.

203
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,686
SO, RACHEL, TELL ME AGAIN
HOW YOU KNOW JEREMY'?

204
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,171
ERM...

205
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,641
RACHEL IS JEREMY'S EX, GERALDINE.

206
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,161
OH, THAT'S IT.

207
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,802
I KNEW IT WAS SOMETHING
I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO MENTION.

208
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,121
WE'RE JUST MATES NOW.
WE'RE TEXT BUDDIES.

209
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,441
HE BBM'S ME EVERY NOW AND AGAIN
AT WEEKENDS.

210
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,644
OH, LOVELY.

211
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,331
YEAH, HE BBM'S ME A LOT TOO.

212
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,402
ALWAYS, ER, BBM-ING.

213
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,521
WHAT IT IS TO BE YOUNG.

214
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,360
IT'S BEEN AGES SINCE
I'VE BEEN IN THIS ROOM.

215
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,885
YOUR DAD USUALLY KEEPS IT LOCKED.
YOU KNOW, AFTER...

216
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,375
WE'RE NOT GOING
DOWN THAT ROAD, GERALDINE.

217
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,641
IT'S A... IT'S A PARTY, REMEMBER?

218
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,609
OH, YES.

219
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,769
<i>♪ WHY AM I ALWAYS THE BRIDESMAID</i>

220
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,923
<i>♪ NEVER THE BLUSHING BRIDE</i>

221
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,527
<i>♪ DING DONG WEDDING BELLS</i>

222
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,968
<i>♪ ONLY RING FOR OTHER GIRLS</i>

223
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,726
<i>♪ ONE FINE DAY</i>

224
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,805
<i>♪ OH, LET IT BE SOON
I SHALL WAKE UP</i>

225
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,807
<i>♪ IN THE MORNING
ON MY OWN HONEYMOON ♪</i>

226
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,291
RIGHT, I'M COMING BACK IN. NOBODY FART.

227
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,329
SMELL THAT. CARBOLIC.

228
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,289
WE SHOULD GET SOME OF THAT
FOR OUR EN SUITEY.

229
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,811
THIS IS FUN, ISN'T IT?
THANK YOU, GERALDINE.

230
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,689
YES, IT IS FUN.

231
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,802
DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND, IAN?

232
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,611
OH, NO. NO.

233
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,848
YOUNG, FREE AND SINGLE, AT THE MOMENT.

234
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,720
I'VE NOT BEEN A MONK.

235
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,366
I'VE HAD SOME EXPERIENCES, BUT NO.

236
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,887
PRETTY BARREN AT THE MOMENT.

237
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,566
A PRETTY ARID PATCH.
OH.

238
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,931
WE HAVE TO GET HIM FIXED UP, WON'T WE?
YES.

239
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,331
DO YOU LIKE HIM, RACHEL?
NO, NO, NO.

240
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,209
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND

241
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,522
WHOSE NAME'S LEE.
DID YOU MEET HIM DOWNSTAIRS?

242
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,605
YES.

243
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,331
HE GAVE ME HIS JACKET AND ASKED ME
TO GET HIM A DRINK.

244
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,481
OH, HE'S ONLY YOUNG.

245
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,891
HOW YOUNG? IS HE LEGAL?

246
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,531
HE'S 21.
OH, A TOY BOY.

247
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,215
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, IF THERE'S GRASS
ON THE WICKET, LET PLAY COMMENCE.

248
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,527
OH, FOR FUCK'S SAKE, STUART,
GIVE IT A REST.

249
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,931
WHAT'S GOT INTO YOU?

250
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,402
CAN'T YOU JUST TALK LIKE A NORMAL
HUMAN BEING FOR FIVE MINUTES?

251
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,803
SHH.
MARK, IN HERE.

252
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,335
HAVE YOU MANAGED TO GET RID OF HIM YET?

253
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,280
YEAH, HE'S GONE OFF
TO LOOK FOR THE OTHERS.

254
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,208
GOD, I LOATHE PLAYING OTHER PEOPLE'S
FAMILY GAMES. IT IS SUCH A BORE.

255
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,848
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY NOW.
YOU SAID WE'D BE AWAY BY THREE.

256
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,295
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO
THE LIE ABOUT THE BABYSITTER BEING ILL?

257
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,403
BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE SEEDED.
YOU NEED TO SEED IT.

258
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,767
IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE SEEDED,
YOU JUST SAY IT.

259
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,604
"OH, I'M AWFULLY SORRY,
WE'VE GOT TO GO NOW.

260
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,409
"BABYSITTER IS NOT
FELLING VERY WELL." BOOM.

261
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,642
YOU'RE SO NAIVE, MARK.
LISTEN, LISTEN,

262
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,930
OLD MAN MAYBE TEDIOUS, BUT
HE'S OUR WAY INTO DICKY LAWRENCE, YEAH?

263
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,445
SO WE HAVE TO PUT A SHIFT IN.

264
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,011
I THOUGHT YOU HATED DICKY LAWRENCE.

265
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,055
YEAH, I HATE DICKY LAWRENCE,
HE'S A FIRST-CLASS PRICK.

266
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,606
BUT I NEED HIM TO SMOOTH
OVER THAT MERGER NEXT YEAR, YOU KNOW.

267
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,368
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,
KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE...

268
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,521
BUT YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER.
OH, YOU'RE SUCH A HORRIBLE SHIT, MARK.

269
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,490
THAT'S WHY YOU BLOODY LOVE ME.

270
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,043
MARK, STOP IT.
COME ON.

271
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,805
JUST FINGERS.

272
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,849
SOMEONE COULD WALK IN ON THEM.

273
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,843
YEAH, WELL THAT'S
THE THRILL OF IT, GERALDINE.

274
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,561
GET OUT THE WAY, I'M GOING TO FILM IT.
NO, YOU DON'T, PERVERT.

275
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,971
QUICK, SOMEONE MAKE A NOISE.

276
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,566
I THINK THAT WAS A BIT TOO SUBTLE, IAN.

277
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,960
GERONIMO!

278
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,685
FUCK!

279
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,041
OH, YOU FOUND US.

280
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,128
WELL DONE.
WHAT THE HELL?

281
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,326
SARDINES.

282
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,926
HELLO, MARK.

283
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,765
WELCOME TO THE WARDROBE.

284
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,371
IAN. I WORK FOR YOU...

285
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,126
IN IT.

286
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,445
OF COURSE, HI. YEAH.

287
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,444
WE'VE BEEN HIDING IN HERE FOR AGES
WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO FIND US

288
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,966
AND THESE DOORS ARE SO THICK.

289
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,362
WE DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING, DID WE?
NO, NO.

290
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,375
DO YOU WANT TO COME IN THEN,
BEFORE DADDY FINDS US?

291
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,401
ERM...

292
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,245
YEAH, I'M A TEENY BIT
WORRIED ABOUT THE BABYSITTER.

293
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,215
SHE SAID SHE'S FEELING
UNDER THE WEATHER.

294
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,810
OH, WELL SEEDED.

295
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,289
NO, I'M SURE WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT
FOR A FEW MINUTES, WON'T WE? YEAH.

296
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,291
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF FUN.
MMM-HMM, MMM-HMM, MMM-HMM.

297
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,201
ALL RIGHT,

298
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,570
I'M GETTING IN.

299
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,135
YES. EVERYBODY WATCH MY SHOES.
OR MAYBE I SHOULD JUST TAKE THEM OFF.

300
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,561
JUST GET IN, LIZ.
IT'S GOOD, THE SOONER WE START.

301
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,966
YOU STAND THERE NEXT TO RACHEL.

302
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,804
REBECCA.
SORRY.

303
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,642
IT'S MY ENGAGEMENT PARTY
AND NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW MY NAME.

304
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,290
NO, IT'S JUST THAT, UH,

305
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,967
YOU KNOW, JEREMY ALWAYS SAYS...
WHAT?

306
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,882
ERM, THIS ONE'S RACHEL.
OH, HELLO.

307
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,923
NICE TO MEET YOU.

308
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,883
NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

309
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,721
AH.

310
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,735
THERE YOU ARE.
I'VE ALREADY BEEN IN HERE ONCE.

311
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,081
LEE, COME IN, WE'RE HAVING SUCH A LAUGH.

312
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,721
WARDROBE. CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T
CHECK THE FUCKING WARDROBE. KNOB.

313
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,163
ALL RIGHT? I THOUGHT I HEARD
SOMEONE SHOUTING.

314
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,005
YEAH, THAT WAS ME.
I SAID, "GERONIMO."

315
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,411
DON'T ASK ME WHY.

316
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,130
HAVE YOU MET EVERYONE, LEE?

317
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,527
THIS IS IAN, HE WORKS WITH MARK.

318
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,840
FOR MARK, ACTUALLY. I OWN THE COMPANY.
OH, YEAH.

319
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,680
WELL, IF YOU EVER NEED
ANY ROOFING DOING.

320
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,929
YOU KNOW REBECCA, OBVIOUSLY.

321
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,651
AND THIS IS MARK'S WIFE, ELIZABETH.

322
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,324
HELLO.
HI.

323
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,368
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU LIKE YOU'VE BEEN CRYING.

324
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,484
OH, IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT DUSTY
IN HERE, THAT'S ALL.

325
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,490
AND, UH, THIS IS REBECCA'S BROTHER CARL.

326
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,884
AND THAT'S STU, HIS...
FLATMATE. PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

327
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,007
FLATMATE?
RIG HT.

328
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,411
AND THIS IS GERALDINE.

329
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,527
OH, YEAH, I KNOW, YEAH.

330
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,175
WOULDN'T MIND A CHEEKY TOP UP,
IF YOU DON'T MIND, LOVE.

331
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,247
PARDON?

332
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,322
A LITTLE CHEEKY CHAMPERS,
THERE'S A GOOD GIRL.

333
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,004
WHY DO YOU KEEP ASKING ME?

334
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,255
WELL, REBECCA SAID
YOU WERE SERVING DRINKS.

335
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,486
NO. NO.

336
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,006
NO, I'M A GUEST.

337
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,844
HE'S GOT HIS WIRES CROSSED.

338
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,730
YES, WE'RE ALL GUESTS HERE. ALL EQUAL.

339
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,484
I USED TO BE THEIR NANNY.

340
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,609
I'VE KNOWN ALL THREE OF THEM
SINCE THEY WERE SO HIGH.

341
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,011
THREE OF THEM?
MM.

342
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,003
YES, WE HAVE A SISTER, CAROLINE.

343
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,090
IS SHE NOT COMING, BECKY?

344
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,607
LOVE TO SEE THE BOYS AGAIN.
THEY MUST BE GETTING QUITE BIG NOW.

345
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,923
AHEM, NO, THEY CAN'T MAKE IT.
IT'S A BIT TOO FAR TO TRAVEL.

346
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,161
OH.

347
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,880
I'LL GO AND GET ME OWN DRINK THEN,
SHALL I?

348
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,726
HERE WE GO, LEE.
I'VE GOT SOME CONTRABAND YOU CAN HAVE.

349
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,968
WE'LL FORM A SPLINTER GROUP
UNDER THE BED.

350
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,963
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

351
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,168
I'M SURE MY FLATMATE WON'T MIND.

352
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,448
COME ON THEN.
MMM.

353
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,206
DON'T YOU TRY AND BURN ME.

354
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,248
I'M SORRY, STUART,
BUT THAT'S AGAINST THE RULES.

355
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,970
ER, HOMOPHOBIC.

356
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,249
OH, YOU'VE GOT THAT, HAVEN'T YOU, LOVEY?

357
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,481
NO, I'M CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

358
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,369
YEAH, WELL, IT IS
A LITTLE CROWDED IN HERE.

359
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,246
YES, IT'S ALMOST LIKE
WE'RE A TIN OF SARDINES.

360
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,255
ACTUALLY, COLIN, WHY DON'T YOU
STEP OUT FOR A MINUTE, YEAH?

361
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,361
GIVE US A BIT OF ROOM.

362
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,805
YES.

363
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,565
I MEAN, IT'S IAN. BUT, YES.

364
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,369
IAN. SORRY. IAN.

365
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,569
UNDER THE BED WITH THOSE TWO, YEAH.

366
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,005
SORRY. PRIVATE PARTY.

367
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,162
LOOK, YOU CANNOT PLAY
SARDINES UNLESS EVERYONE

368
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,242
IS HIDING IN THE SAME PLACE TOGETHER.

369
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,800
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT FUN!

370
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,764
OH, YES. OH, LEE, THAT'S NICE.

371
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,640
OH, KEEP DOING THAT.
WHAT BIG HANDS YOU'VE GOT. OH, YES!

372
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,526
LEE?

373
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,251
BABE, I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

374
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,930
LEAVE HIM ALONE, STUART.

375
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,775
OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER, CARL?
ARE YOU JEALOUS?

376
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,962
PISS OFF.
STOP ARGUING, YOU TWO.

377
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,371
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

378
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,375
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOU'RE AFRAID OF INTIMACY, CARL.

379
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,209
AND IT'S NOT FAULT EITHER.

380
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,411
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

381
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,250
TA-DA.

382
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,608
JOHN.
OH,

383
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,047
LOOKS LIKE I'M ONE OF
THE LAST TO JOIN THE PARTY.

384
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,443
CAN I SQUEEZE IN?
NO.

385
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,810
I JUST THINK IT'S A BIT TOO FULL.

386
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,208
NO. THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM.

387
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,525
I FEEL SICK.
BREATHE THROUGH YOUR MOUTH.

388
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,126
ACTUALLY, JOHN, SOME PEOPLE
ARE HIDING UNDER THE BED.

389
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,575
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.
COULD YOU SWAP?

390
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,090
I'M A BIT CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

391
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,605
THAT'S NOT THE GAME, IS IT?

392
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,287
YOU'RE ALL MEANT TO BE
SQUASHED IN TOGETHER.

393
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,681
THAT'S THE RULES.

394
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,535
YES, BUT WE THOUGHT IT DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER ABOUT THE RULES.

395
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,847
AS LONG AS WE'RE ALL IN
THE SAME ROOM, IT STILL COUNTS.

396
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,131
OH.

397
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,288
ALL RIGHT, AS YOU WISH.

398
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,009
ACTUALLY, JOHN, THERE REALLY ISN'T ROOM
UNDER HERE. THERE'S, ERM...

399
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,447
THERE'S SUITCASES AND EVERYTHING,
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, LEE?

400
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,646
YEAH, RIGHT, MATE.

401
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,131
<i>SORRY.
OH .</i>

402
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,135
OH, I DON'T THINK I'D FIT UNDER
THERE ANYWAY, TO BE HONEST.

403
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,164
WHAT WITH THE OLD 26 PACK.

404
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,167
YEAH, YOU'RE BETTER OFF
GOING WITH THE WARDROBE GROUP.

405
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,241
ALL RIGHT.

406
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,844
I'M BACK AGAIN.

407
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,209
HANG ON.

408
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,520
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

409
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,809
IS IT CAUGHT OR SOMETHING?
OH, IT'S STUCK, JOHN.

410
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,488
MAYBE TRY GOING IN THE BATHROOM.

411
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,686
FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.

412
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,250
I CAN SEE WHAT IT IS.

413
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,170
IT'S FINGERS.

414
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,695
SOMEONE'S HOLDING IT WITH
THEIR FINGERS.

415
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,881
NO, WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH IT.

416
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,769
OH, LET HIM IN. POOR LAMB.

417
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,365
WE CAN'T. MARK, TELL THEM.

418
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,771
TRY GOING BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

419
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,005
OH.
ALL RIGHT.

420
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,641
FUNNIEST GAME OF SARDINES
I'VE EVER PLAYED.

421
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,001
AH.

422
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,007
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN REBECCA ANYWHERE,
HAVE YOU, JOHN?

423
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,521
CAUGHT RED-HANDED.

424
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,682
SHE'S, UH, HIDING IN THE WARDROBE.

425
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,240
BUT YOU CAN'T GET IN.
DOOR'S STUCK APPARENTLY.

426
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,725
RIGHT. THANKS.

427
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,450
AND THERE'S TWO UNDER THE BED.

428
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,608
IT'S A SHAMBLES.

429
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,680
BECKS,

430
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,171
IT'S JEREMY.
HI.

431
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,575
LISTEN, DARLING, I'VE JUST GOT
TO POP DOWN TO THE STATION

432
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,320
AND PICK UP A CHUM
WHO'S RUNNING A BIT LATE.

433
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,760
I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND MY KEYS.
YOU HAVEN'T HAD THEM, HAVE YOU?

434
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,848
UH, NO, THEY'RE IN YOUR JACKET.

435
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,295
NO, I'VE LOOKED,
THEY'RE NOT THERE.

436
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,495
IF I CAN'T FIND THEM, I MIGHT HAVE
TO TAKE THE MINI, IS THAT OKAY?

437
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,806
ALL RIGHT.

438
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,120
DRIVE SAFELY THOUGH.

439
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,922
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU TOO, RACHEL.

440
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,040
REBECCA.

441
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,285
ERM... REBECCA, I LOVE YOU.

442
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,729
WHAT IS THAT AWFUL SMELL?

443
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,720
HELLO, ANDREW.
SEARCHED THIS ROOM, HAVE YOU?

444
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,209
YES, I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME
PEOPLE HIDING IN THE WARDROBE.

445
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,368
SOME UNDER THE BED AND STINKY JO...

446
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,364
AND JOHN IS BEHIND THE CURTAINS.

447
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,807
NO, THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG.

448
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,570
COME OUT FROM THERE, BOY.

449
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,082
YOU ALL HAVE TO BE IN THE SAME PLACE.

450
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,969
THIS ISN'T HIDE AND GO SEEK.

451
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,845
YOU KNOW THE RULES, DON'T YOU?

452
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,004
WELL?
YES, SIR.

453
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,169
COME ON. OUT. OUT.

454
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,925
IT'S LIKE <i>THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK.</i>

455
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,047
HI, DADDY.

456
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,884
FIVE MORE SARDINES TO GO IN THE TIN.

457
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,360
SORRY, ANDREW, IT'S JUST I NEED TO...
COME ON, IN YOU GO.

458
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,330
THAT'S IT.

459
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,161
COME ON, IN YOU GO.

460
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,208
UGH! SORRY, EVERYBODY.

461
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,326
THERE WE GO.

462
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,687
THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME, SARDINES.

463
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,286
THIS IS FUCKING MENTAL.

464
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,051
OH, I'VE GOT...
I'VE GOT TO TWEET A PICTURE OF THIS.

465
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,290
OH, GOD, HERE YOU ARE.
ALL RIGHT, SMILE, EVERYONE.

466
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,724
IT'S JUST THEY
BOTH START WITH AN R, SO, I ER...

467
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,442
WOULD ANYONE LIKE A MINT?

468
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,365
JOHN?

469
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,205
NO, THANK YOU.

470
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,129
ARE YOU SURE? THEY'RE VERY REFRESHING.

471
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,241
THEY, ER, GIVE ME DIARRHEA.

472
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,122
OH, DEAR GOD.

473
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,005
I'LL HAVE ONE ACTUALLY. I'VE GOT
SOMETHING CATCHING IN ME THROAT.

474
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,730
PASS 'EM AROUND.

475
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,086
HERE.

476
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,731
ANDREW, ELIZABETH WAS JUST
ASKING AFTER DICKY LAWRENCE.

477
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,485
HOW IS HE THESE DAYS?
DICKY LAWRENCE?

478
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,409
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HIM IN TWO YEARS.

479
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,602
DREADFUL MAN.
RIGHT, I THOUGHT...

480
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,481
AH, YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO USE ME
AS A STEPPING STONE, DID YOU?

481
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,726
WELL, TOUGH TITTY.

482
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,327
THAT BRIDGE WAS BURNED A LONG TIME AGO.

483
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,761
BABYSITTER?

484
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,162
YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE
WITH HER, AREN'T YOU?

485
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,200
WE USED TO LOVE PLAYING
SARDINES AT PARTIES, DIDN'T WE, DAD?

486
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,691
OH, YES.

487
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,202
WE USED TO CALL IT AN ICEBREAKER.

488
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,886
DO YOU REMEMBER THE SARDINES SONG?
OF COURSE.

489
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,771
<i>♪ A BABY SARDINE
SAW HIS FIRST SUBMARINE ♪</i>

490
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,729
DON'T YOU DARE SING THAT.

491
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,606
MY HOUSE, I'LL DO WHAT
I BLOODY WELL LIKE.

492
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,601
IS IT JUST ME OR IS THERE LIKE
A SHITTY SMELL IN HERE?

493
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,890
DO YOU REMEMBER THE YEAR WE HAD
THE CUB SCOUTS' JAMBOREE?

494
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,801
CHAOS IT WAS. KIDDIES EVERYWHERE.

495
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,689
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

496
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,849
WE WERE HAVING SUCH A LAUGH.

497
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,602
AND THEN THIS ONE LITTLE BOY SPOILED IT.

498
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,566
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

499
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,122
I REALLY THINK WE OUGHT
TO BE MAKING A MOVE NOW.

500
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,931
OH, THE POLICE WERE
INVOLVED AND EVERYTHING.

501
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,889
DO YOU REMEMBER, JOHN?

502
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,282
PHILIP HARRISON.

503
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,442
THAT'S IT, LITTLE PIP.

504
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,760
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM?

505
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,605
FAMILY MOVED AWAY, AS I RECALL.
SPAIN OR SOME SUCH.

506
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,446
MMM, GOOD RIDDANCE, I SAY.

507
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,251
ACCUSING YOU OF SUCH HORRIBLE THINGS.

508
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,689
HE PAID THEM TO GO AWAY.

509
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,361
I WAS TEACHING THE BOY
HOW TO WASH HIMSELF.

510
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,006
BASIC HYGIENE.

511
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,851
WELL, WE WEREN'T ALL THAT LUCKY,

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,525

514
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,843
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH!

515
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,165
NOW BEFORE I RING JEREMY KYLE,
CAN I JUST SAY,

516
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,528
THERE'S NO ONE ACTUALLY LOOKING
FOR US ANYMORE. WE'RE ALL HERE.

517
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,284
NO, NO, THAT IAN FELLA'S NOT HERE.

518
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,815
YES, I'VE GOT TO GO AND PICK HIM UP
FROM THE STATION ACTUALLY. SO...

519
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,128
ERM, HE'S IN THE BATHROOM I THINK.

520
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,727
ER, BORING CHAP WITH GLASSES.

521
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,201
OH, NO, THAT'S NOT IAN.
